BUG FIXED!!
The bug was in the slShaderManager.java: I was repeatedly compiling the vertex shader only
and did not link the shaders at all :-(
Both bugs fixed now! But took some effort :-(

===========================================================================================
This version compiles and runs; but does not display the color I am expecting to see.
Not sure whether my logic is wrong or there is a bug :-(
============================================================================================
Crated slRenderer Component
============================================================================================
1. Move the polygon to the center and increase the size. The image is larger and more
centered.
2. Moving to Component Based, Data-Oriented System: not done yet; but is compiling and
running at the previous level, showing the textured rectangle again!
============================================================================================
Removed the motion of the rectangle. Now Mario is static!
